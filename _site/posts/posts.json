These plans are required to improve the welfare of the people and induce the creation of better social, economic and physical environments. Government bodies often create untargeted and uniform policies or strategies that hope to address the majority of the issues in the country. They often fail to consider the specific needs of each group that are across the country.\r\nWith spatial information being affected by many factors, there could be many different factors why and how occurrences of events are clustered or segregated in certain locations. We attempt to create a generalised Geographical Segmentation tool to identify clusters within any datasets to perform in-depth analysis.\r\nGeographic Segmentation divides and separates a target market into different segments by using geographical location, to better serve and target each segment specifically. This is often done based on geographic information and also various other factors such as climate, cultural preferences, populations and more.\r\nIf government policies are untargeted and irrelevant, it will be costly and damaging. Geographical segmentation is an effective approach for government bodies to identify the specific needs of each segment to better serve them.\r\nObjectives\r\nIn this project, we will be creating a Geospatial Analytical Tool that will help users to unveil valuable insights by analyzing the spatial-temporal patterns of the different clusters of events within any datasets.\r\nTo visualize the distribution of the events\r\nTo identify clusters of events\r\nTo conduct Spatially Constrained Clustering Analysis and Segmentation\r\nData\r\nIn order for our team to create and test the functionalities and effectiveness of our application, we will be using 2 datasets and will look to add on to this list nearing the completion of our project:\r\nAirbnb Listings for June 2019 and 2020 in Singapore (Downloaded from Inside Airbnb)\r\nChildcare Centres in Singapore (Downloaded from data.gov.sg)\r\nLiterature Review\r\nIdentifying High-risk Geographic Areas for Cardiac Arrest Using Three Methods for Cluster Analysis\r\nAim of Study: Identify high-risk census tracts, defined as those areas that have both a high incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and a low prevalence of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), by using three spatial statistical methods.\r\nMethods of Study:\r\nGlobal Empirical Bayes Works by adjusting rates towards the global mean of the observed data with the amount of shrinkage inversely proportional to the size of the population at risk. Local Moran‚Äôs I Measures the degree to which similar observations tend to occur to each other so that local areas of similar value may be defined as a cluster SaTScan‚Äôs spatial scan statistic Employs a spatial scan statistic to draw circles of varying magnitude, which are set by the user, around an area, comparing the observed versus the expected outcomes in that area.\r\nLearning Points:\r\nPycnophylactic interpolation was used to estimate population counts for portions of census tracts lying within the Columbus city boundaries. This allows a smooth population density surface covering the study area.\r\nSpanish unemployment: Normative versus analytical regionalisation procedures*\r\nAim of Study:\r\nThe study compares the two types of regionalisation approaches: (a) normative regions (towns, provinces etc.) and (b) analytical regions that are directly related w/ the analysed phenomena. For this study, two types of analytical regionalisation models were applied: a two-stage procedure based on cluster analysis and the other one based on mathematical programming. The results are that analytical regions lead to ‚Äúmore homogeneous regions‚Äù and are ‚Äúmore stable over time and with the effects of scale‚Äù.\r\nTypes of Regionalisation:\r\nNormative Regionalisation\r\nFixed according to political, historical or cultural factors that are officially established\r\nMay not be appropriate for the considered problem e.g.¬†for regional effects of monetary & fiscal policies, results may be affected if the aggregated areas in each region are heterogeneous\r\n\r\nAnalytical Regionalisation\r\nFunctional zones designed according to geographical criteria (altitude) or socio-economic criteria (homogeneity). The goal is that areas belonging to the same region are as homogeneous are possible with respect to:\r\nGeographical contiguity: The aggregation of areas (small spatial units) into regions such that the areas assigned to a region must be internally connected or contiguous.\r\nEquality: In some cases, it is important that designed regions are ‚Äúequal‚Äù in terms of some variable (for example population, size, presence of infrastructures, etc).\r\nInteraction between areas: Some variables do not exactly define geographical characteristics that can be used to aggregate the different areas, but perhaps they describe some kind of interactions among them (for example, distance, time, number or trips between areas, etc).\r\n\r\nMethods of Study:\r\nTwo-stage Strategy\r\nFirst stage: Conventional Clustering Model\r\nHierarchical\r\nPartitional - which the paper chose, and used K-Means clustering.\r\nMini rundown of K-Means clustering: initial centroids are explicitly or randomly assigned, then the other elements are assigned to the nearest centroid. Afterwards, initial centroids are reassigned in order to minimize the squared Euclidean distance and the process is re-iterated until there is no more change in centroids/until stopping point (e.g.¬†number of iterations). Do note that it‚Äôs quite difficult to obtain the global optimum solution due to the randomness of the initial centroids.\r\n\r\nSecond stage: Cluster Revision (in terms of geographical contiguity) - if the areas included in the same cluster are geographically disconnected, those areas are defined as different regions\r\nAdvantage: homogeneity of regions is guaranteed by the first stage\r\nAdvantage: obtain evidence of spatial dependence among the elements\r\nDisadvantage: number of groups depends on the degree of spatial dependence and not on the researcher criteria\r\n\r\nMathematical Programming (RASS - Regionalisation Algorithm with Selective Search)\r\nLooks to minimising the sum of the heterogeneity measures of each class (region) r (aka total heterogeneity), forming an automated regionalisation model whose characteristics are:\r\nDesign a given number of homogeneous geographical units from aggregated small areas subject to contiguity requirements\r\nFormulates the regionalisation problem as a linear optimisation problem, which ensures the possibility of finding the global optimum among all feasible solutions\r\nMore coherent solutions can be easily obtained introducing additional constraints related to other specific requirements that are relevant for the regionalisation process\r\nWith this model a region consists of two or more contiguous areas, which implies that any region can be formed by a unique area\r\n\r\nLearning Points:\r\nNormative Regionalisation may not always be appropriate due to some underlying factors\r\nAnalytical Regionalisation takes into account functional zones, geographical contiguity, equality and interaction between regions.\r\nPolygon-based Regionalisation in a GIS Environment\r\nAim of Study:\r\nDespite the fact that the underlying data representing spatial entities is widely available in GIS-compatible frameworks, the task of defining areas is still mostly done manually, that is, without the use of strict algorithms with explicit parameterization. According to Openshaw (1996), one of the most essential and highly relevant spatial analysis jobs that still needs to be conceptualized for widespread application is the analysis of spatial information aggregated to zones, hence the importance of the task. This study comes out with regionalization that is well-defined and parameterized.\r\nMethods of Study\r\nPolygon-based regionalisation using a spatial contiguity constraint\r\nStarting with a predefined set of seed polygons, a region-growing technique is used, followed by a stepwise aggregative clustering strategy.\r\nHistory tracking\r\nEach merged OTU is assigned a unique time stamp identification number in a separate table (history ID). As a result, the region-building sequence for all initial polygons = operational taxonomic units may be assessed and analyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample\r\nBuilding autonomous regions based on renewable energy consumption and sources - The data is based on the combined effective production potential of renewable energy sources such as hydropower, wind, and photovoltaic energy, as well as biomass conversion and geothermal energy. After subtracting the power consumption per unit, a polygon layer represents the pooled energy supply potential.\r\nApproach\r\nClustering: Local Moran‚Äôs I\r\nLocal Moran‚Äôs I is a local spatial autocorrelation statistic that identifies local clusters or local outliers\r\nIt is calculated as follows:\r\nWhen zi and zj are the observations in deviations from the mean and wij is the spatial weight matrix element. Positive values of Ii suggest that there is a spatial cluster of similar values and negative values of Ii, represent a spatial cluster of dissimilar values\r\n\r\nPolygon-Based Regionalisation - stepwise aggregative clustering strategy\r\nInteraction between segments\r\nstarting seeds/manually input (eg population centres)\r\n\r\nAnalytical Regionalisation: start with (hierarchical)\r\nThere will be 2 stages to Analytical Regionalisation\r\nK-means clustering\r\nIterative method to derive clusters from the dataset\r\nIt is an algorithm that attempts to minimize the distance of the points in a cluster with their centroid and maximize the distance between the centroids across clusters.\r\n\r\nCluster Revision\r\nIf areas that are within the same cluster are geographically disconnected, these areas will be defined as different regions\r\n\r\n\r\nMinimum spanning trees clustering algorithm (SKATER package)\r\nMinimum spanning tree clustering algorithm is known to be capable of detecting clusters with irregular boundaries\r\nTwo minimum spanning tree (MST) clustering algorithms will be applied\r\nProduce a k-partition of a set of points for any given k, then construct a MST of the point set and remove edges that satisfy a predefined criterion. This process is repeated until k clusters are produced.\r\nPartition a point set into a group of clusters by maximizing the overall standard deviation reduction, without a given k value.\r\n\r\nHierarchical clustering : (ClustGeo package)\r\nThere are two methods of hierarchical clustering.\r\nAgglomerative clustering\r\nWorks in a bottom-up approach\r\nEach object being considered as a single element cluster(leaf).\r\nAt each step of the algorithm, 2 most similar clusters will be combined into bigger clusters (nodes).\r\nThis combining process is done until all points are members of just 1 single big cluster (root).\r\n\r\nDivisive hierarchical clustering.\r\nTop-down approach\r\nInverse order of Agglomerative clustering\r\nBegins are the root where all objects are included in a single cluster\r\nAt each iteration, the most heterogeneous cluster is divided into 2\r\nThis process is repeated until all objects are in their own cluster\r\n\r\n\r\nSpatially constrained cluster analysis\r\nEdge cost calculation\r\nComputing spatially constrained clusters using SKATER method\r\nVisualising the cluster in choropleth map\r\nApplication Sytem\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication Storybaord\r\n\r\n\r\nTimeline\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a clearer version, kindly open the image in a new tab, or download our pdf.\r\nAcknowledgement: Created using TeamGantt template\r\nReferences\r\nSasson, C., Cudnik, M.
